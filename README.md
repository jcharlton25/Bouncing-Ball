# Bouncing-Ball
Bouncing Ball is my first coding challenge with MIT xPRO, which had us simulate a ball bouncing around the screen. As an extra challenge, we were to program a color change every time the ball detected an edge.

## Roadmap
There may be updates made to these files as my course progresses and my skills grow. 

## Installation
Download the files from my repository, open the folder in your documents/finder, then open the html file to view.

## Usage
These files were in part of a project for a coding cohort and are intended to help grow my skills. Bouncing Ball is open source and can be used for commercial and open source projects.
